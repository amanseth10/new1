    <h1>About Sparrow...</h1>
    <p>A sparrow is a member of the genus Passer. They are small passerine birds which belong to the family Passeridae.
        They are also known as old-world sparrows. Sparrows often make their nests near houses or buildings. This means
        they are one of the easiest birds to see in the wild.

        The genus has about 30 species around the world. The best known of these is the house sparrow, Passer
        domesticus.</p>
    <h1>About Parrot...</h1>
    <p>Parrots are birds of the order Psittaciformes.There are about 372 species in 86 genera. They are found
        in most tropical and subtropical regions. The greatest diversity of parrots is found in South America and
        Australasia.

        Parrots are intelligent birds. They have relatively large brains, they can learn, and they can use simple
        tools.[5] Because some species have the ability to make sounds like human voices and have plumages with bright
        colors, many species are kept as pets. This includes some endangered and protected species. Parrots are very
        clever</p>
